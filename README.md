# Auto-BackPork
A project to make backport for the PS5 using [BackPork](https://github.com/BestPig/BackPork) easy and fast.

## F.A.Q

### What is this ?
This is a project that allow you to downgrade, fake signed and add fakelib to you'r ps5 games easily.

### Why using this ?
This project work using directories, simply put a input directory and a ouput directory, everything else is done automaticlly.

### Where can i find the decrypted games files and the fakelib files ?
For legals reasons (and because i don't want my github account banned lol) i can't help with that here.

## How to use

- Make sure to have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
- Put you're patched and signed sprx files inside the folder **"fakelib"**.
- Once you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) run 
```bash
 python Backport.py -c
```
- You can choose between 3 mode : downgrade, decrypt or full, if you don't have the decrypted files of you're games you can choose the full option otherwise choose downgrade (default one).
- For the first option (input directory) put the directory of you're game files.
- For the second option (output directory) put the directory where you're downgraded and signed game files should be save.
- If you don't know what the others options are doing keep the default value.
- When you are sure of you're configuration simply type "y" to confirme.
- When it's done you should have all the game files downgraded and signed with the fakelib folder, you can now copy and replace you're old game files (make sure fakelib is in the root of the game folder).
- Make sure to run the Backpork payload (you maybe have to run [chmod_rec](https://github.com/zecoxao/chmod_rec) too).

### One line command
You can also run a one line command, for exemple to simply downgrade to 7.00 and sign your game:
```bash
 python Backport.py --input "/home/user/ps5/decrypted" --output "/home/user/ps5/signed" --sdk-pair 7
```
Or if you want to also decrypt the fake sign ELF:
```bash
 python Backport.py --mode full --input "/home/user/ps5/encrypted" --output "/home/user/ps5/signed" --sdk-pair 7
```

### Python library
You can also use this project as a Python library, for exemple:
```python
from Backport import PS5ELFProcessor
    
# Initialize processor
processor = PS5ELFProcessor(use_colors=True)
    
# Decrypt files
results = processor.decrypt_files(input_dir="input", output_dir="decrypted")
    
# Downgrade and sign files
results = processor.downgrade_and_sign(
	input_dir="decrypted",
	output_dir="signed",
	sdk_pair=4,
	paid=0x3100000000000002,
	ptype=1,
	fakelib_source="fakelib"
)
    
# Full pipeline
results = processor.process_full_pipeline(
	input_dir="encrypted",
	output_dir="final",
	sdk_pair=4,
	paid=0x3100000000000002,
	ptype=1,
	fakelib_source="fakelib"
)
    
# Revert libc patch
results = processor.revert_libc_patch(input_dir="signed_files")
```


## TODO
- [X] Add FSELF decryptor.
- [X] Add support for 6.xx (need some more testing).
- [ ] Add BPS files patcher.
- [ ] Add a GUI.
